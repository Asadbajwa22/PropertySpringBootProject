# PropertySpringBootProject
Project for Property trackers
Asad Bajwa

The outline for this project was to create a CRUD application that utilised all of the core modules that have been taught during our training thus far. For this project I was required to download Visual Studio Code and use Eclipse for Java / Spring Boot.

Breakdown:

Project management - A Jira board which shows full and clear documentation from a design phase. As well as this my code must be integrated into the Version Control System.

Databases - A relational database to store persistent data from the project.

Java SE & Spring Boot - Using OOP language, a functional application needs to be created.

Testing - Using Mockito and JUnit, 60-80% + test coverage must be carried out.

Front End Development - Establish a functioning front end web page with API integration.

Planning resources:

As we were taught in our first weeks at QA, we should use Jira to plan our projects and use them initially. My first step was to get onto Jira and create a Kanban board, on which I then created various epics and user stories. The user stories I created were made to help me achieve my end goal properly and an example can be shown here:

The next important planning stage for me was to think about my design concept for my website. I used Invision Freehand and created a very basic layout for my website to which I kept to throughout my project. 

Once I had the design of my website I then got started on my back end work which consisted of coding in Java and running these codes as Spring Boot applications. 

The user will be able to create, update, delete and view all properties in the system - A java backend application will work with a MySQL database.

Spring Boot was used as a tool to implement Java CRUD functionality - this was done by creating a PropertyController class, and methods were added for the functionality.

For Front end creation - Visual Studio code was used.

Acknowledgments - I would like to thank everyone at QA, especially my trainers over the past 2 weeks - a huge shout out to Shafeeq for his enthusiasm and entertaining style of teaching and Pawel for his fantastic explanations.
